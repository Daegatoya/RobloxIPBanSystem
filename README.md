# RobloxIPBanSystem
This project is a website that can be used by any roblox game in order to fetch the user's IP, allowing them to be IP banned afterwards. Works with HTTP requests through an express server.

## DISCLAIMER

This project is NOT TO BE USED FOR ANY NON ETHIC USAGE. It is purely done for IP bans and not to threat anyone. I do not and will not stand with any illegal usage of this website.

The CSS part of this project was NOT MADE BY ME. The server side and the JS was made entirely by me.
